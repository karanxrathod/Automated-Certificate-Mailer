#    Rename it to 'new_registrations.csv' or change the filename below.
# 2. The main student list is named 'students.csv'. This script will create it if it
#    doesn't exist, or update it if it does.

# IMPORTANT: Set the column numbers (indexes) for the name and email.
# The first column is 0, second is 1, and so on.
# From your original script, Name was the 3rd column (index 2) and Email was the 4th (index 3).
