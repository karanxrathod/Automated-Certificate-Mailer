## How to Use üìã

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Automated-Certificate-Mailer.git](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Automated-Certificate-Mailer.git)
    cd Automated-Certificate-Mailer
    ```

2.  **Create your configuration file:**

3.  **Organize your files:**

    - Place your `students.csv` file in the project directory. It must have `Name,Email` columns.
    - Create a folder (e.g., `certificates/`) and place all certificate PDF files inside.

4.  **Update the paths in `send_emails2.py`** to point to your logo, CSV file, and certificates folder.

    ```bash
    python send_emails2.py
    ```
